function [recordedaudio, perf] = audioDuplex(varargin)

%% Function for passing audio through (duplex mode) with PsychPortAudio
%
% USAGE: [recordedaudio, perf] = audioDuplex(devName='MAYA22 USB', lat=0.1, maxLength=150)
%
% Based on DelayedSoundFeedbackDemo of Psychtoolbox.
%
% Function for testing Psychtoolbox's PsychPortAudio for duplex mode audio with
% the sound cards in the lab. 
% The function openes an audio device in recording + playback mode and tries
% to push the input out with "lat" latency. Builds heavily upon PsychDemos
% examples. 
%
% Aborts for ESC.
%
% Inputs:
% devName       - Char array, name of the audio device to use. Defaults to
%                       'MAYA22 USB', that is, the current USB sound cards in the lab.
% lat                   - Numeric value, requested latency in seconds. PsychPortAudio
%                       will complain if it thinks the latency is too short. Defaults to 
%                       0.1 sec. Should be in range [0 10]
% maxLength     - Numeric value, maximum time of audio device operation in
%                       seconds. Function aborts when "maxLength" is reached. Defaults
%                       to 150 secs. Should be in range ]10 1000]
%
% Outputs:
% perf                 - Struct, storing various performance-related variables.
