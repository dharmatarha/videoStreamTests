function sharedStartTime = UDPhandshake(remoteIP, remotePort, localPort, startDelay, maxDiff, maxTimeOut)
%% Function to negotiate a common start time across systems on local network
%
% USAGE: sharedStartTime = UDPhandshake(remoteIP, 
%                                       remotePort=9998, 
%                                       localPort=9998, 
%                                       startDelay=10, 
%                                       maxDiff=0.1, 
%                                       maxTimeOut=60)
% 
% The function solves the problem of starting processes approximately
% synchronously across two machines linked on a local network.
%
% Assumptions:
% - System clocks are more-or-less synched (ideally with only 1-2 ms difference max)
% - Network time is reasonable for local network (few ms max)
%
% The function must be run on both machines. 
%
% At first, both instances send "greetings" messages to the remote IP and keep  
% doing so until they detect the same message coming from remote IP. 
% Packets are sent every 10 ms (controlled by hardcoded param "waitTime").
% Detection of "greetings" message should happen more-or-less synchronously 
% at both machines (with jitter of "waitTime" + network transmission + clock difference).
%
% Next, machines exchange current time by sending each other the timestamp 
% generated after detecting "greetings" message. If the difference between the
% local and remote timestamps is too great (>maxDiff), the function errors out
% as system clocks are probably seriously out-of-sync.
% If the difference is within tolerance, a common start time is derived at both end
% by averaging the two timestamps and adding a fixed delay ("startDelay"). 
%
% Shared start time is now the same timestamp on both machines, "startDelay" 
% secs in the future.
